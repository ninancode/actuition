# Actuition

## Project Description
Actuition is a tuition reimbursement management system. Users are able to make requests and be reimbursed accordingly based on the amount of funds that are available, approvals, and their final grade.

 ## Technologies Used
 * React - version 16.14.2
 * AWS DynamoDB - version 2019.11.21
 * Express.js - version 4.16.1
 * TypeScript - version 4.1.3

## Features
 Actuition allows users to make requests for reimbursement on events such as:
* University Courses - 80%
* Seminars - 60%
* Cerification Preparation Classes - 75%
* Certification - 100%
* Techinical Training - 90%
* Other - 30%
 
 Requests have to go through a chain of approvals before it can be considered pending for reimbursement. Once the user's final grade or presentation is approved, the user then receives the reimbursement.
